Rather, mindfulness is about bringing our full awareness to whatever is present for us, including our thoughts. In this meditation, you will practice naming the kinds of thoughts coming up for you. You will learn how to be the observer of your own thinking, which ultimately will allow you to respond to events in your life with wisdom, rather than being a reaction to them.\nby Christina McMahon\nAbout AURA",

   "Description": "This short meditation practice can be helpful at times when the mind is really active, agitated or restless. By engaging the mind in focusing on a breathing routine and counting each breath up to twenty-one, the mind is encouraged to become calmer and more focussed. However, our intention is merely to encourage the mind, not to force it. We are approaching the practice with a sense of non-striving, allowing the mind to be as it is; if it is willing to settle, that’s fine, if not, that’s fine too – we simply notice it’s activity. If you become distracted and lose track of counting at any point, or if you reach twenty-one, simply begin again at one, and any time you wish to, simply let go of counting and observe the breath.\nby William James Davies, DCMT\nAbout AURA",
